    "description": "Proximity Adjusted Centroid MAPping (PAC-MAP) is a novel and deep learning-based method for nuclei detection in 3D light microscopy images of (dense) 3D cell systems with a nuclear-specific stain. It works by predicting proximity adjusted centroid probability maps in which nuclei locations are found as local maxima.",
